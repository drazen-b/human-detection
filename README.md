# human-detection

Goal of this project is to train few models and compare performance of their algorithms.

## Goals List

This is current list of steps in this project, it will be updated through time.

TODO:
- [ ] Find dataset
- [ ] Discover algorihtms
- [ ] Create environment
- [ ] Create models for all algorithms
	- [ ] YOLOv8
	- [ ] YOLOR
	- [ ] HOG
	- [ ] R-CNN
- [ ] Create and implement in Android app
	- [ ] Make image input
	- [ ] Make video input
	- [ ] Make camera input
- [ ] Compare performances and results

## Datasets

Current dataset I'm using is [Roboflow Human Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/dgist-9qtzz/human-3zoj7).

It contains 5108 annotated images of humans.
